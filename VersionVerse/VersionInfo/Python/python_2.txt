Python 2.7 was released on July 3, 2010. It marked the final major release in the Python 2.x series and was intended to provide a smooth transition path for Python 2.x users to migrate to Python 3.x. Python 2.7 included several new features and improvements over Python 2.6, and some of the notable features and changes include:

1. Syntax Enhancements:
   - Extended `with` Statement: Python 2.7 allowed the use of multiple context managers in a single `with` statement, similar to Python 2.6.

     Example:
     
     with open('file1.txt') as file1, open('file2.txt') as file2:
         # code that uses file1 and file2
     

   - `print` Function**: Python 2.7 introduced the `print` function, which provided a way to use the print statement as a function. This feature aimed to make it easier for Python 2.x code to be compatible with Python 3.x.

     Example:
     
     print("Hello, World!")
     

2.Performance Improvements: Python 2.7 included various performance optimizations and enhancements, making it faster and more efficient than Python 2.6 in certain cases.

3.`unittest` Module Enhancements: The `unittest` module received further enhancements, making it more powerful and flexible for writing unit tests.

4. New and Updated Modules:
   - `collections` Module: Python 2.7 introduced the `Counter` class to the `collections` module, which makes it easier to count occurrences of elements in sequences.

   -`argparse` Module: The `argparse` module was added to the standard library, providing a more powerful and flexible way to parse command-line arguments.

   - `io` Module Enhancements: The `io` module was improved for handling input and output operations more efficiently.

5.Security Enhancements: Python 2.7 included various security-related updates and fixes to ensure code security.

6.Library Updates and Bug Fixes: Python 2.7 included numerous updates and bug fixes throughout the standard library to enhance stability and performance.

7.Backwards Compatibility: Python 2.7 aimed to maintain a high degree of compatibility with Python 2.x code, making it easier for users to transition to Python 3.x gradually.

It's important to note that Python 2.7 was the last major release in the Python 2.x series, and its development and support ended on January 1, 2020. Since then, Python 3.x has been the actively developed and recommended version of Python, with Python 3.9 being the latest release as of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021. All Python 2.x versions, including Python 2.7, are no longer receiving official updates or security fixes, so it is strongly advised to migrate to Python 3 for ongoing development and maintenance.
