Concepts Expansion: C++20 introduced concepts, and C++23 may further expand on their use and capabilities. This could include more standardized concepts in the Standard Library and improvements in how concepts are applied.

Ranges Enhancements: C++23 may include refinements and additions to the Ranges library introduced in C++20, providing more functionality and making it easier to work with sequences of elements.

Reflection: C++23 might introduce some form of reflection, allowing developers to inspect and manipulate program structures at runtime. This could include features like type introspection and runtime type information (RTTI) improvements.

Metaclasses: Metaclasses, if introduced, could provide a powerful mechanism for code generation and metaprogramming, making it easier to generate boilerplate code and simplify complex template-based solutions.

Contract Programming: C++23 may introduce contract-based programming, allowing developers to specify preconditions and postconditions for functions, improving code reliability and safety.

Pattern Matching: Pattern matching is a feature often discussed for C++. If included, it could simplify complex conditional logic and provide more expressive ways to work with data structures.

Compile-Time Programming: C++23 may extend the capabilities of constexpr programming, allowing for more complex computations and metaprogramming at compile time.

Standard Library Improvements: Expect enhancements and additions to the Standard Library to provide more tools and data structures for common programming tasks.

Concurrency Enhancements: C++23 may introduce further improvements in the area of concurrency and parallelism, building on the foundation laid by previous standards.

Networking: The Networking Technical Specification (TS) may become part of the C++23 standard, providing standardized support for network programming.

Deprecation and Removals: Like previous standards, C++23 may deprecate or remove older features and practices to encourage better coding practices and reduce language complexity.

Backward Compatibility: C++23 is likely to maintain backward compatibility with previous versions of C++ to ensure that existing code can be easily migrated.
