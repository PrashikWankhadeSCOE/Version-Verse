Generic Lambdas:

C++14 extended lambda expressions to allow auto-typed parameters, enabling lambdas to work with a wider range of argument types without explicit type specification.
Return Type Deduction for Functions:

C++14 introduced return type deduction for normal functions, allowing you to omit the explicit return type and have it deduced by the compiler based on the return statement(s).
Variable Templates:

C++14 introduced variable templates, which are similar to function templates but allow you to define variables that depend on a template parameter.
Aggregate Member Initialization:

C++14 relaxed the rules for aggregate initialization, allowing data members to be initialized using parentheses (e.g., MyStruct s = {1, 2}).
Digit Separators:

C++14 introduced digit separators (single quotes) within numeric literals to improve readability (e.g., 1'000'000 instead of 1000000).
Relaxed constexpr Restrictions:

C++14 relaxed some of the restrictions on constexpr functions, making it more flexible to use constexpr for compile-time computations.
Binary Literals:

C++14 introduced support for binary literals using the 0b prefix (e.g., 0b101010), enhancing readability for binary representation.
Library Enhancements:

C++14 added several library features, including new algorithms, such as std::make_unique and std::exchange, and improvements to existing library components.
std::index_sequence and Related Features**:

C++14 introduced std::index_sequence and related features to work with compile-time sequences of integers, making it easier to implement advanced metaprogramming techniques.
Compile-Time Variables:

C++14 allows you to declare variables in constexpr functions and use them as compile-time constants.
Heterogeneous Lookup in std::unordered_map and std::unordered_set:

C++14 introduced support for heterogeneous lookup, enabling you to search for elements in unordered containers using a different type than the container's key type.
Relaxed constexpr Expressions:

C++14 extended the set of allowable constexpr expressions, making it more permissive and allowing a broader range of compile-time computations.
User-Defined Literals for Standard Library Types:

C++14 allowed user-defined literals for several standard library types, enhancing user customization and interoperability.
Binary Literals and std::byte:

C++14 introduced binary literals (e.g., 0b1010) and a new standard library type std::byte, making it easier to work with raw binary data.
std::tuple Enhancements:

C++14 improved std::tuple by adding std::get functions and other utility functions to work with tuples more easily.
