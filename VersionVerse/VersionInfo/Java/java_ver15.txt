As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, Java SE 15, also known as JDK 15, was a non-LTS (non-Long-Term Support) release of the Java Platform, Standard Edition. It was released on September 15, 2020. Like other non-LTS releases, Java SE 15 had a shorter support lifecycle compared to LTS releases, typically receiving updates for six months.

Some of the notable features and improvements introduced in Java SE 15 included:

1.Sealed Classes: This feature allows you to specify which classes can be subclasses of a given class. It provides more control over class hierarchies and enhances encapsulation.

2.Hidden Classes: Hidden classes are classes that are not directly accessible by normal class loaders. They can be used to implement frameworks and libraries that need to generate classes dynamically without polluting the class namespace.

3.Text Blocks Enhancements: Text blocks, which were introduced in Java SE 13 and further improved in Java SE 14, received additional enhancements in Java SE 15.

4.Pattern Matching for instanceof (Second Preview): Pattern matching for `instanceof` was enhanced as a second preview feature, with improvements based on user feedback.

5.Unix-Domain Socket Channel: This feature introduced a new Unix-domain socket channel to provide socket communication between processes on the same system using Unix domain sockets.

6.Deprecations and Removals: Java SE 15 deprecated and removed certain classes and features that were considered obsolete or no longer recommended.

It's worth noting that non-LTS releases like Java SE 15 are typically used by developers who want to take advantage of the latest language features and APIs while being prepared to upgrade to the next LTS release when it becomes available.

Please keep in mind that Java releases and their features may have evolved beyond my last knowledge update in September 2021. I recommend checking the official Oracle or OpenJDK website for the most current information on Java releases and their features as of your current date in 2023.
