J2SE 1.4, also known as Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition 1.4 or Java 2 SE 4.0, was a major release of the Java platform, bringing significant enhancements, features, and performance improvements. It was released on February 13, 2002. Here are some of the major features and enhancements introduced in J2SE 1.4:

1.New I/O (NIO) API:J2SE 1.4 introduced the New I/O API, often referred to as NIO. This API provided better support for scalable and high-performance I/O operations, including non-blocking I/O, memory-mapped files, and efficient handling of large data sets.

2.Assertion Mechanism:J2SE 1.4 introduced the assertion mechanism, allowing developers to add assertions to their code to validate assumptions and conditions. Assertions helped improve code quality and simplify debugging.

3.Logging API:J2SE 1.4 included the Java Logging API, which provided a standard way to log messages and events in Java applications. It offered greater flexibility and configurability compared to previous logging solutions.

4.Regular Expressions:This release introduced the java.util.regex package, which included support for regular expressions, making it easier to perform complex pattern matching and text processing tasks.

5.XML Processing:J2SE 1.4 included built-in XML processing capabilities through the inclusion of the JAXP (Java API for XML Processing) and SAX (Simple API for XML) APIs. These APIs allowed developers to parse and manipulate XML data easily.

6.Preferences API:J2SE 1.4 introduced the Preferences API, which provided a platform-independent way to store and retrieve user and system preferences. This made it easier to create applications with customizable settings.

7.Chained Exception Handling:J2SE 1.4 improved exception handling by allowing exceptions to be chained together, providing better information about the root cause of an error.

8.Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) Improvements:JNDI received enhancements, including improved support for LDAP, enabling better integration with directory services.

9.Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE):The JCE was strengthened in this release, offering more cryptographic algorithms and capabilities for secure communication.

10.Java Web Start:J2SE 1.4 included Java Web Start, a deployment technology that allowed Java applications to be launched directly from the web, simplifying distribution and updating of Java applications.

11.Java Compiler Enhancements:This release introduced improvements in the Java compiler, including support for the "assert" keyword and the ability to generate metadata for annotations.

12.Performance Enhancements:J2SE 1.4 included numerous performance improvements in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and core libraries, resulting in faster execution of Java applications.

13.Security Enhancements:Security features were enhanced with better support for code signing and improved access controls.

14.Unicode 3.0 Support:J2SE 1.4 added support for Unicode 3.0, providing better handling of international character sets and text encodings.

J2SE 1.4 was a significant release that improved the capabilities of the Java platform, making it more powerful and versatile for a wide range of application development scenarios. Many of the features introduced in this version laid the groundwork for subsequent Java releases.
