Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition 5 (J2SE 5), also known as Java 5 or Java 1.5, introduced several significant features to the Java programming language. It was officially released by Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle Corporation) on September 29, 2004. Some of the major features introduced in J2SE 5 include:

1.Generics: Generics allow you to create classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on typed parameters, enabling you to write more type-safe and reusable code.

2.Metadata Annotations: Annotations provide a way to add metadata to your code, which can be used by tools or frameworks for various purposes like code generation, documentation, and runtime behavior.

3.Enhanced for Loop: The enhanced for loop (also known as the "for-each" loop) simplifies iterating over arrays and collections, making code more readable and less error-prone.

4.Autoboxing and Unboxing: Autoboxing and unboxing simplify the process of converting between primitive data types (e.g., int) and their corresponding wrapper classes (e.g., Integer) automatically.

5.Enumerations: Enumerations (enums) allow you to define a fixed set of constants, making your code more readable and less error-prone when dealing with predefined values.

These features marked a significant step forward in Java's evolution, improving code readability, type safety, and developer productivity. J2SE 5 laid the foundation for many of the modern Java language features and libraries we use today.
