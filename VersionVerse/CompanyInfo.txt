The provided JavaFX application, named "FirstPage," presents 
a dynamic and user-friendly interface that serves as a gateway
to the "Version Verse" project. The application is divided
into two panes, with the left pane displaying company 
information and logos while the right pane serves as the 
primary user interaction area. Users can input their name,
select a language from a dropdown list, and choose a version 
from another dropdown list. Upon clicking the "Get me information" button,
the application retrieves and displays relevant project information in a 
text area. Additionally, users can access a feedback form with a star 
rating system via the "Feedback" button, providing valuable input for 
continuous improvement. The application showcases the integration of JavaFX 
UI elements, file reading, database connectivity using JDBC, and interactive
 features to enhance user engagement.
